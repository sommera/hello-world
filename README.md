# hello-world
This is my first project. Hope it goes well.
My small experience with coding has been with the language Python. I was given a book about how to code games and was able to make a few of them. It started out well, but soon things started to get complicated and I had no-one to ask questions. I soon turned to  YouTube and watched a few lessons. This was nice to have someone explain everything, but again, I had no one to ask a question when I was confused about a section.
